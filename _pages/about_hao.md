[Hao Zhang](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~haozhang/) studies the intersection area of machine learning and systems. He is equally interested in designing strong, efficient, and secure machine learning models and algorithms, and in building scalable, practical distributed systems that can support real-world machine learning workloads. Recently, he has developed open models and systems to democratize the access of Large Language Models (LLMs). He also co-founded [LMSYS Org](https://lmsys.org/).
